**Libraries Used:** 
Spotify API for Developers, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy 

**Description:** 
The purpose of this project is to explore and learn to work with APIs. In this case I choosed working with Spotify API as I love music and because I wanted to explore what was the current state of the Latin American Artists in the world. I have been noticing that their music was becoming more popular in many parts of the world like North America, Australia and Europe. 

I decided to compare Latin American singers versus North American singers since the last ones have been always popular aroung the globe. For this, I extract the information of the singers using Spotify's Documentation:

https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-an-artist

I extracted values for each singer like followers, popularity (Spotify's Rating) and genres played. 

**What I have learned so far from this project:**

- How to create an access token
- Extract the Data using Spotify's API
- Convert the collected data into Pandas dataframe
- Perform data analysis and visualization task using different python libraries
